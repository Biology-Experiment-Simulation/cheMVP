ABOUT
=====
cheMVP is free, open-source software designed to make clean, simple molecule
drawings suitable for publications and presentations.  The program is written
in C++, using the QT library and some icons from the SVG icons project.

OUTPUT FORMATS
==============
cheMVP can generate PDF, SVG, EPS, PS, PNG and Tiff images.  The PDF, SVG and
PostScript formats are recommended, as they are vector formats, which means
that they are scalable and can be manipulated with software such as InkScape
(free) or Adobe Illustrator (not free, but very powerful).  PNG files seem to
be smaller than Tiffs, so they are probably a bit better.  The file type is
determined by the extension used in the filename.  An experimental CVP format
is being developed to save the project, allowing the user to save the project's
state and load it again.

BASIC USAGE
===========
Most buttons and settings apply only to the selected items.  In select mode,
clicking outside of the molecule and dragging a rectangle over molecule
components will select them, or clicking individual components will
select/deselect them.  To add a bond, click the "add bond" mode button, click
the first atom and drag the mouse over the second atom to be bonded and
release.

INPUT FORMATS
=============
Currently, only xyz files are supported.  These take the form

NumberOfAtoms  [bohr or au]
Comment Line
Atom1Symbol Atom1XCoordinate Atom1YCoordinate Atom1ZCoordinate
Atom2Symbol Atom2XCoordinate Atom2YCoordinate Atom2ZCoordinate
Atom3Symbol Atom3XCoordinate Atom3YCoordinate Atom3ZCoordinate
etc..

the optional argument after the number of atoms is only necessary if the units
are atomic units.  Eventually the code will parse output files.  Soon it will
be able to load from its own project files (.cvp).  MAB-ACESII (now called
Cfour) produces a JMOL.plot file, which is readable by cheMVP.

COMPILING
=========
If you can't find a pre-compiled binary for your OS, then to compile from
source is pretty simple.

1) Download and install QT from http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource/appdev
2) Head into the compilation directory in the chemvp source folder
3) Type 'qmake'
4) Type 'make'
